# Pseudocode
    # Assign numbers as an empty list
    # Create a loop that continuously asks user for input until invalid input
    # Create a condition to meet the expected outcome
        # Create an operation using functions sum() and len()
        # If numbers entered is greater than zero
            # Print average
        # If numbers is less than or equal to zero
            # Print 'No numbers entered'
